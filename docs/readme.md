  ## Renewable energy production in Florida
  
  [Area Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/areachart)
  
  I chose an Area Chart for this data, because I thought that it best showed the growth of renewable energy generation over time. I chose to display the hAxis data in reverse so that it progressed chronologically to show growth.
  
  ## Electricity total consumption in Florida
  
  [Line Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart)
  
  I chose a Line Chart for this data, because it also shows a time-based progression of energy use. I could have used an Area Chart as well, but I wanted to use 2 different charts to get more practice. I reversed the hAxis of this data as well, so that it displayed chronologically.

Because the data sets share a common time frame, it would have been especially interesting to show the two within the same chart for comparison (however, that wasn't the assignment.)
