# State of Current Site

  ## Accessibility Audit
  
  Using Chrome Dev Tools accessibility audit:
  * Images do not have alt tags.
  * Not all link text is semantic.
  * Not enough color contrast between background and foreground.
  * Form fields do not have labels.
  * Pages do not have print-friendly versions.
  

  ## Mobile Friendliness
  
  * Overall layout is not responsive.
  * Images are not responsive, sizes are static.
  * Tables are used for non-tabular content.
  * Content is shrunken on mobile devices, making text hard to read and link targets difficult to touch.
  
  
  ## Performance
  
  [Home page](http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/)
  Using Chrome Dev Tools performance audit:
  * First meaningful paint: 3 seconds
  * Fully interative load: 20 seconds
  * Javascript boot-up time: 9 seconds
    * JS scripts may be more complex than needed
  Using webpagetest.org grades:
  * First byte time: F
  * Compress images: C
  * Cache static content: F
  
  [Biomass and Biofuels](http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/fl-energy-industry/under-construction/)
  [Note:] This page's url is not semantic and seems to be a placeholder.
  Using Chrome Dev Tools performance audit:
  * First meaningful paint: 3 seconds
  * Fully interative load: 10 seconds
  * Javascript boot-up time: 7 seconds


  ## Functionality
  
  * The search bar is using up too much space at the top.
  * Layout of main content is not very consistent across pages. It looks like different people designed different pages.
  * Facility links in footer should have larger click target (make the entire white oval clickable.)
  * Poor use of padding or margins on some pages makes text appear crowded. [Example](http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/energy-education/free-online-courses/)
  
  
  ## Ease of Use
  
  * Inconsistent use of color - the colors do not indicate anything helpful.
  * Links are not always the same color. Hard to quickly understand what is clickable.
  * Some navigation links are internal, some are external, and some open PDFs, but there is nothing to indicate the difference.
  * Having two navigation menus (without full context about why they are separate) is confusing.
  * The side menu changes based on which page you're on. It's overwhelming to see this many pages without clearer organization.
  * Some of the menus have sub-sub-menus.
  * [Sitemap](http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/sitemap/) is blank.
